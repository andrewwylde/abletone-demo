This is a repo for the post I wrote about reading uglified stuff and trying to logic about code you didn't write.


## Install

It's recommended to use the latest LTS Node (currently `v6.10.3`, I'll try to keep this updated).

* `npm install`
* `npm start` - builds using [docker](https://github.com/jbt/docker) (not that docker) and watches the `src` directory
* `npm run serve` - serves `dist/` on port 9002.

After you're set up with `start` and `serve` running, check out the file list and click on the `start-audio-context.js.html` to see the documentation side-by-side.
